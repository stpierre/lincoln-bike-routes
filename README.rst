 GeoJSON for Lincoln, NE, bike routes
======================================

This repo contains approximate, unofficial GeoJSON data describing the
bikeways in Lincoln, NE. Currently included are:

* All off-street and street-adjacent bike paths, as determined by a
  mix of the (woefully out-of-date) `GPTN trail map
  <http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/parks/parksfacilities/trails/links/2008_GPTN_Trails_Map.pdf>`_,
  Google Maps' cycle route data, and personal experience.
* All downtown on-street bike lanes that I'm aware of. All of the maps
  are surprisingly inaccurate about this.
* Major paths through parks, especially those that are particularly
  long or connected to the bike path system.

Currently missing are:

* Paths through the several university campuses. There are just too
  dang many.
* Short paths through parks, or park paths that are disconnected from
  the greater trail network.
* Minor spurs or access paths.
* On-street bike routes.

There are certainly more things missing, incorrect, or slightly
inaccurate. This was all done by hand in my spare time. Eventually I
hope to improve coverage.

The routes are categorized according to whether they are off-street,
street-adjacent, on-street painted, or on-street protected. The
difference between "off-street" and "street-adjacent" is often fuzzy,
but my basic criterion for a street-adjacent path was that multiple
residential streets or private drives crossed the path. There's
certainly room for argument about many of these.
